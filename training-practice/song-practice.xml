                Think of <placeName>London</placeName>, small city
                It's dark, dark in the daytime
                People sleep, sleep in the daytime
                If they want to, if they want to
                
                I'm checking 'em out, I'm checking 'em out
                I got it figured out, I got it figured out
                There's good points, some bad points
                But it all works out, though I'm a little freaked out
                I'll find a city, find myself a city to live in
                I will find a city, find myself a city to live in
                
                Lot of rich people in <placeName>Birmingham</placeName>
                Lot of ghosts in a lot of houses
                Look over there! Dry ice factory
                Good place to get some thinking done
                
                I'm checking it out, I'm checking it out
                I got it figured out, I got it figured out
                There's good points, some bad points
                But it all works out, you know I'm a little freaked out
                I'll find a city, find myself a city to live in
                I will find a city, find myself a city to live in
                
                I'm checking 'em out, I'm checking 'em out
                I got it figured out, I got it figured out
                There's good points, some bad points!
                But it all works out, sometimes I'm a little freaked out
                I'll find a city, find myself a city to live in
                I will find a city, find myself a city to live in

                Home of <persName>Elvis</persName> and the ancient Greeks
                Do I smell? I smell home cooking
                It's only the river, it's only the river
