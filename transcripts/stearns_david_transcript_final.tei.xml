    <body>
      <u who="RIDKER">This is <persName>Elena Ridker</persName>. I have <persName>Dave Stearns</persName> on the other line for an oral history interview. <date>Today</date> is <date>May 20th</date>. It’s <date>Wednesday</date>. I am sitting in <persName>Rauner</persName> [<orgName>Special Collections] Library</orgName>. It’s about 3:15 p.m.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Sure. Thank you.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">So just to get started, we’ll start with some biographical information, so where and when were you born, and what were your parents’ names?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">[Chuckles.] Oh, sure. Yeah, I was born in <placeName>Springville</placeName>, <placeName>New York</placeName>, a little town about 30 miles south of <placeName>Buffalo</placeName>. My dad is <persName>Howard Gordon Stearns</persName>, and mother is <orgName>Grace Harvey Stearns</orgName>.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">And what was it like growing up in <placeName>New York</placeName>?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Ah! A little town. My mom was the—when I was a little kid, my mom was the switchboard telephone operator in town, so if I wanted to talk to her, any phone would do. I’d just have to pick it up and say, “Mom?”, and she would be there. It also worked the other way. It meant if I was in trouble anywhere in town, the neighbors could pick up the phone and say, “Grace, your son is outside doing this. You better do something about it. So it was a very small town. It was a pleasant place to grow up.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">What can I say about it? It used to be farming country and is, to some degree, but a lot of that is going back to forest. I’m not sure exactly what people do there anymore. I haven’t been back there except to visit gravesites and stuff with my grandparents, for quite a while. </u>
      <u who="RIDKER"><persName>Mm-hm</persName>. And did you have siblings, and were you close with them?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Oh, sure. Yeah, I was the youngest of four kids. For <placeName>Springville</placeName>, I guess you’d say it was a fairly intellectual family. We all went to college, to some degree. I mean, my next older brother didn’t spend much time there. He spent more time drinking beer than studying, I think, but he ended up becoming one of the earliest real computer programmers for money, and he was sort of how I got into my occupation. In <date>1968</date> I went down and visited him and asked—you know, I was troubled about what to do, and he said, “Why don’t you come down to my company and take an interview and aptitude test?” And I did, and that made me a programmer, and that’s how I made my living.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Interesting.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Let’s see. I don’t know what kind of material <date>you’re</date>—the background stuff: pretty typical white-bread kind of town. I have this story that my paternal grandfather was actually in the <orgName>KKK</orgName> [<orgName>Ku Klux Klan</orgName>] in upstate <placeName>New York</placeName> back in the—back in <date>the ’30s</date>, when the <orgName>Klan</orgName> was not just an anti-black organization; it was an anti-Catholic organization as well. And upstate <placeName>New York</placeName> in <date>those days</date> was being—from the standpoint of the old white Protestant guys who had farmed that country first, it was being sort of invaded by Catholic Europeans, who were changing the politics from, you know, white-bread Republican to, you know, more liberal Democrat kind of things. And that’s the way <placeName>Erie County</placeName> is <date>today</date>. It’s run more by Democratic folks in <placeName>Buffalo</placeName> than it is by the Republican folks out in the suburbs and the country.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Hmm. And so what kind of things did you do in high school, and I guess how did that lead you to going to <orgName>Dartmouth</orgName> [College]? </u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Oh, well, sure, yeah. I went to high school in <placeName>Orchard Park</placeName>, <placeName>New York</placeName>, where the [Buffalo] Bills’ stadium is now. It’s a little farther toward <placeName>Buffalo</placeName>. And the schools there were excellent, in my opinion. It was back when—I don’t know if teachers got paid an especially living wage, but it was a respected profession, and a lot of the people who taught were sharp, really good people. I think I had a great background in math and English in particular, though I liked doing everything.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">What kind of other things on campus were you involved in on campus?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Oh, at <placeName>Dartmouth</placeName>? I was in the [<orgName>Dartmouth</orgName>] Outing Club, in particular the <date>winter</date> sports stuff. As I said, I was interested in skiing, and it was—in return for working at ski meets occasionally, we got access to ski passes at the Dartmouth Skiway for free. So basically skiing was free for me, and I always used to organize my winter classes so I didn’t have anything in the afternoons, if possible, so I could just go and ski.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">I think it’s—<orgName>Panarchy</orgName> is inside the house now.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Thank you, thank you, <orgName>Panarchy</orgName>.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">They occasionally send me e-mails, hoping, I’m sure, that I would donate some money. [Laughter.] But so far, I haven’t. My charity is mostly organized through <orgName>Rotary [International</orgName>].</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Okay. Yeah, the house is still standing, so—and it looks great.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Yeah, it was a beautiful place, and it was—you know, it was an interesting bunch of guys. I enjoyed my time there. So I did get married at the end of my junior year, so—and at that point, I dropped out of the fraternity.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Was that—was it common to get married that early or—at that time?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Oh, heck no. No, no, no, no, no. You know, my wife—I went to high school with my wife. Or actually earlier. I met her in seventh grade. And so we’d been dating off and on for—what? We started dating when we were 18, and she was back in <placeName>Buffalo</placeName>, studying nursing at a nursing school associated with a hospital there, and she was graduating in <date>June</date> of ’67, and so we got married. We just thought, you know, we were already committed to each other; why not do that? And then she could go to <persName>Mary Hitchcock</persName> [<orgName>Memorial Hospital</orgName>, now <orgName>Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center</orgName>], where she could be a nurse, and I could live off campus. And it was great, you know. Worked out well for us. I can’t say—you know [chuckles], hardly anybody gets married anymore at <date>21</date>, but it wasn’t like it was all that weird in <date>those days</date>, although most of my friends—</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">—weren't married.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">That’s interesting. So it seems like—so you were on campus at <placeName>Dartmouth</placeName> from ’64 to ’68? Is that correct?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Right. Yes, right, yeah.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">And so that was a very interesting time to be on campus in terms of campus climate surrounding issues about civil rights and <name type="event">the Vietnam War</name>, and I’m just wondering how that influenced you or how you kind of experienced that.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Oh, I wasn’t certainly involved much in that stuff, though, you know, you certainly get involved in your share of discussions about things. Just—well, you know, it was that kind of time. You know, that was when there was a lot going on in the country right then. You know, the march on <placeName>Selma</placeName> had taken place—when? <date>The year before</date>, I think. It was ’63 I believe. And certainly, since the [<name type="event">Vietnam] War</name> was cranking, that was always a big topic of conversation and, you know, a lot of ferment [sic; foment] involving that. You know, I could enlarge on some of that if you want me to. I’m not quite sure how much associated stuff you’ve done—you know, historical stuff—with the college and what went on. I’m not sure what year <persName>SDS</persName>, for example, Students for a Democratic Society, was founded, but it was around in there, and we had a pretty active chapter. We used to do a lot of consciousness-raising stuff.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER"><persName>Mm-hm</persName>. </u>
      <u who="STEARNS">—says when things would happen. Probably it was my sophomore or junior year. <persName>SDS</persName> announced that they were going to “burn a puppy for peace,” which—boy, you’ve never seen people get so upset. It was really amazing how upset—and the fraternity extended to the people who were on the, you know, full military, <orgName>anti-SDS</orgName> kind of side, and then there was always, of course, a strong liberal component at the college who were, you know, anti war. And the whole thing sort of caught people’s attention. They were going to do it on <date>a certain day</date>.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Were your—</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">I’m sorry. Go ahead.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">No, no, sorry. Continue.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Oh, I was just going to mention that there was also—I remember [unintelligible] at the fraternity. You know, we used to occasionally have faculty members come up to give talks, and we had—I wish I could remember the guy’s name. He was a professor of Asian studies, Buddhist religion and stuff like that. I mean, he knew quite a bit about Southeast Asian history. And he was antiwar, and so he came and talked to the fraternity. And we had two guys who were actually <orgName>ex-Army</orgName>, both came. This was after <placeName>Korea</placeName> [<name type="event">the Korean War</name>], of course. But <date>early days</date> of <placeName>Vietnam</placeName> were sort of before I arrived at college, but these guys were never anywhere near that. They were both, like, European posting <orgName>Army</orgName> guys. One of them I think spent a lot of time in <placeName>Iran</placeName> at a listening post and stuff.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Hmm. Did you have any fraternity brothers who had been drafted?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Gee. Those two guys—you know, in <date>those days</date>, intelligent people didn’t get drafted. All you had to do was go to college. Or get married and have a kid. It was very easy to get out of the draft, and only—only until, you know, <placeName>Vietnam</placeName> really got cranked up and started to need a lot of men, there really—it just wasn’t a threat to intelligent white guys. I’m sure that, you know, black guys in <placeName>Buffalo</placeName> right along were probably getting drafted. My draft board was in <placeName>Buffalo</placeName>, so they were probably taking those guys off the street and sending them off to fight, but everybody I knew that I went to high school with, which was also a pretty white-bread area—until they got out of high school and then didn’t go to college, it was no threat to them. So certainly I knew high school people who went into the <orgName>Army</orgName>, though, you know, I didn’t keep an awful lot of track. I since discovered by going back to high school reunions that several of them were in the war and a few of them died.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">And so were you trying to find a way to avoid the draft?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">After hearing about this?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Oh, wait. I don’t know if—there was sort of a major antiwar event at commencement. Our valedictorian stood up. What was his name? [<persName>James W.] “Jamie” Newton</persName>, maybe? Can’t remember his last name. Heck of a nice guy. Had him in a lot of my psych classes. And he was—he announced his own intention to go to <placeName>Canada</placeName> and advised us to all go, too. And at that point, a whole bunch of people stood up and started to either cheer or boo. You know, it was—for a commencement, it was probably a pretty exciting commencement. I don’t think too many had happened like that. Usually it’s a pretty cut-and-dried affair. And happier affair than it was in this case. And he did go to <placeName>Canada</placeName>. Eventually came back when the Carter Act [sic; <persName>Carter</persName> Pardon Proclamation] went through. I forget what they called it. They said: All is forgiven. You guys can come back. And he became a faculty member in <placeName>Canada</placeName>, I think, but came back, and now I believe he’s back in the <placeName>U.S.</placeName> I haven’t kept track of him.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Oh, I was just wondering—so after—as you were graduating, were you trying to figure out a way to avoid the draft?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Yeah. Frankly, yes. I could not believe that I could go to <placeName>Canada</placeName>. I mean, it seemed to me that, you know, although I hated the war—I thought it was a terribly bad idea, very unfortunate for <placeName>the United States</placeName> as well as unfortunate for <placeName>Vietnam</placeName>. I certainly wasn’t excited about going, so I was, you know, torn on these two things. Like, you know, It’s my country. I’ve got to do what they say, and I don’t really want to fight in this war, though I do.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Yeah. Do you mind speaking a little bit about what basic training was like at Fort Ord?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Let’s see. Well, I sure met a cross-section of <placeName>California</placeName> younger humanity there. [Chuckles.] The guys I hung out with were Southern Californians, for the most part. I was technically a Northern Californian, since I’d gone in from <orgName>Point Conception</orgName> [unintelligible]. And a lot of guys who came in, <date>the first day</date> you saw them, they still had the long hair. You know, they were hippie-looking guys, their eyes still bleary from having, you know, pulled the biggest party they could possibly do before they actually went into the <orgName>Army</orgName>. So they were all, you know, hung over, and bloodshot eyes. Experts in dope, in <date>those days</date>, compared to, you know, an innocent guy like me from <placeName>the East Coast</placeName>.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Hmm.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">So I’ve always thought that was one thing—you know, it’s one of those classic bird in the hand versus one in the <persName>bush</persName> situations where, boy, I should have made the other choice.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Hmm. So you ended up going to Fort Hood instead.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Yes. Yes, and I forget what my MOS was—sorry, after having worked in the <orgName>Army</orgName>, the military has a lot of TLAs, three-letter abbreviations, and MOS is one of them, as his HAP. MOS is military occupational specialty. And when you leave basic, you got an MOS. If you’re bound for the infantry, it’s infantry, and if you’re bound for the artillery, it’s artillery. So mine was something vaguer than that. Computer systems guy, I guess, something like that.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">I was just going to ask what kinds of specific things were you programming for?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Oh, let me think. Let me think. The parts and stuff, supplies, everything. You know, any big, complicated organization has big, complicated lists of supplies they need, and they got to keep them ordered, and they need to know where stuff is, so that’s what the computer systems basically do. Now you have—you know, the computers are much smaller, and, you know, it’s all web based and stuff, but in <date>those days</date>, if you wanted to know if you had—how much spare tank tread you had for <orgName>M60</orgName> tanks, you had to go over to where the big listings were, thumb through the thing to find the right page, and see dut, dut, dut, dut, dut, dut, dut—okay, we got 20 pairs; we probably need to order another 300 because we’re running out. So it was basically keeping track of objects, accounts of things. So nothing sophisticated at all. It was just doing what computers do really well, is count this stuff.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">And were you anxious at all at this time about getting <placeName>Vietnam</placeName> orders, or were you kind of thinking you might stay there a little longer?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Oh, yeah. I mean, it—it wasn’t clear—they probably wouldn’t have made me an infantry guy at that point because it’s a specialty, too, and, you know, if you’re really an infantry guy it isn’t just, “Hey, you know, I carry a gun and go out and patrol.” There’s a—after basic, there’s an extensive thing called advanced infantry training, where you learn to do the serious things: you know, how to avoid ambushes and how to really kill other people, the important things you need to know if you’re in the infantry. And I didn’t have any of that training, so it isn’t likely that that would have happened to me in any case. </u>
      <u who="RIDKER">So how did you prepare for your departure, and when exactly did you go?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Oh. [Laughs.] You know, the biggest hassles were personal because, you know, <persName>Bonnie [Stearns</persName>] and I had to pack up the stuff and figure out where she was going to go. And she was by that point pregnant, so the biggest hassle was arranging somewhere for her to live while I was in <placeName>Vietnam</placeName>, and we ended up going back to the <placeName>Buffalo</placeName> area, getting an apartment for her, which wasn’t too far from where her mom and dad lived, and she, you know, had lots of friends around that area, so she had people she could rely on for help when she—as she was going through the pregnancy.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">In fact, I did quite well in that part of it. When I was in basic training, I was one of three guys, I think, who got the sharpshooter qualification. I have a little medal someplace that shows I was really good at target shooting.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Hmm.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Anyway, <placeName>Oakland</placeName>. I still remember the day I flew out. It was one of those beautiful <date>winter days</date>.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">And the people who smoked ran off the plane and lit up cigarettes. But I ran into the bar and found a glass of Scotch. Probably two. And then we jumped back in and flew on. I think we flew probably directly into <persName>Tan Son Nhut</persName> [Air Base] in <placeName>Vietnam</placeName> in <date>those days</date>.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Sorry, into where?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS"><persName>Tan Son</persName> <persName>Nhut</persName>. It was the <placeName>Vietnam</placeName> name for <orgName>the Air Force</orgName> base just outside of <placeName>Saigon</placeName>.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER"><persName>Mm-hm</persName>. And so what were your first impressions of <placeName>Vietnam</placeName> like?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Oh. Yeah, as I—hey, give me a second here, would you? Hold on. I’ll get a glass of water.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Sure.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">My throat is sore.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Flew into—I don’t remember landing, but it was <name type="event">New Year’s Eve</name>, and we got posted over to <persName>Long Binh</persName>, which was <orgName>the U.S. Army Vietnam</orgName> headquarters, and shown our, you know, groggy eyes into—into a place where we could sleep for the night. So I laid down, went to sleep. Was awakened by gunfire. God, machine guns! There’s stuff goin’ on outside. Holy shit! You know, this is terrible? I just arrived in country, and already I’m in a war!  And it turned out—no, no, it’s just the guys celebrating <name type="event">New Year’s Eve</name>. It was unsanctioned, but, you know, a lot of people have ammunition and guns, and they were a little drunk, so they went outside and shot off the guns, just like they do in big cities everywhere in the <placeName>U.S.</placeName> now.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">So I went back to sleep. Woke up and turned in—turned over my papers to the—to the company commander and those guys who control that kind of stuff and received my job, which was going to work at a computer center at this <orgName>Army</orgName> headquarters. And so for a war job, it was a great war job because we worked in an air conditioned building, in a pretty well-protected place. This particular area—the only time that it had been fought over, I think, during <name type="event">the Vietnam War</name> was during <name type="event">the Tet Offensive</name>, when a—</u>
      <u who="RIDKER"><persName>Mm-hm</persName>. </u>
      <u who="STEARNS">And I can’t go into it in any depth, but there were guys around who pointed out, you know, where <placeName>the North Vietnamese</placeName> or Viet Cong invaders actually got inside <placeName>Long Binh</placeName> and holed up in the sort of forested area in the middle, and it took, like, <date>three days</date> to herd them out of there and kill them all. So that was within the memory of, you know, the people who were there when I was there, although there really wasn’t any danger except, of course, from your fellow soldiers. You weren’t liable to be shot by a Vietnamese, but you could be shot by, say, an angry black guy, that was a possibility.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">And what were your <date>daily</date> tasks? Like, can you describe <date>a typical day</date>?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Oh, gee. Well, as I said, I was, you know, a computer programmer in an air conditioned building. I worked with a bunch of other guys who were pretty much like me. You know, they were relatively overqualified for what they were doing, and, you know, we spent a lot of time, you know, bullshitting about what we’d rather be doing and writing COBOL applications to—guess what—count things. You know, the particular one that I worked on was helicopter parts accounting. And I had a lieutenant that I worked fairly closely with, who sort of knew the specs, and he and I would work through the details of what he wanted, but I was the one who actually executed the—wrote the code to figure out how to do what you wanted done.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">So it was keeping track of helicopter parts—</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Yes, right.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">—and things like that?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Yeah. You know, in <date>those days</date>, the <orgName>Army</orgName> was going through a lot of helicopter parts. Not only were they being shot down, which happened occasionally, but they just wore them out. You know, they’re big, complicated devices with lots of whirring parts, so they needed lots of rotors and lots of engines and et cetera.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">And were you doing any systems analysis about the, like, efficacy of helicopters and the parts, or was it mainly just keeping track of everything?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Keeping track of everything, yeah. I hope to God there were people who worried about that, but it wasn’t me. That’s for sure. You know, that note I sent you—I don’t know if you—if you have a chance to read many books about <placeName>Vietnam</placeName>, but the one I left and mentioned at the very bottom was my absolute favorite. It’s called A Bright Shining Lie[:John Paul Vann and <placeName>America</placeName> in <placeName>Vietnam</placeName>]. It’s about <persName>John Paul Vann</persName>, who was instrumental in the war, died in the war, was a critic of the way the military ran it. And, you know, hopefully people at his level were worried about the efficacy of flying helicopters around, shooting people, ferrying soldiers around.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Mmm.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">You know, when you look back on it, the whole war was a tremendous waste, just a tremendous waste. If we just—you know, when <placeName>Hồ Chí</placeName> [which he pronounces to rhyme with sky] <persName>Minh</persName> came to talk to the <orgName>U.N.</orgName> [<orgName>United Nations</orgName>], I suppose it was after <name type="event">World War II</name>, if somehow [Secretary of <orgName>State</orgName>] <persName>John Foster Dulles</persName> had said, “Yeah, it’s a good idea. Let the Vietnamese run the country,” it would have saved so much trouble! [Laughs.] You know, I mean, the French wouldn’t have had to go through [<name type="event">the Battle of] Dien Bien Phu</name>, and we wouldn't have had to go through <name type="event">the Vietnam War</name>. </u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Hmm.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Very odd, when you look back on it, how a country that’s supposedly led by intelligent adults like <placeName>the United States</placeName> can make such terrible choices once in a while in the wars that it fights.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Yeah, so I guess I was asking specifically about systems analysis stuff because I know that <name type="event">the Vietnam War</name> was, like, one of the first wars to kind of use electronic data extensively, especially under [Secretary of <orgName>Defense</orgName> <persName>Robert S.] McNamara</persName>. I was wondering if you at the time, like, had any opinions about the use of data collection or if you were mainly just kind of—</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Oh—</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">—invested in what you were doing.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Oh, oh, oh, I see what you’re getting at. That’s a wonderful question, but at the time I was there, it didn’t mean anything to us. Nothing at all. I mean, that was the kind of argument that was going on at the <orgName>Pentagon</orgName> and in [President <persName>Lyndon B.]</persName> <persName>Johnson</persName>’s office, right? I mean, <persName>McNamara</persName> would come in with I’m sure his <orgName>ins</orgName> and outs, his counts. They were saying, you know, “Good God, look. They can’t hold out much longer. We’re killing them at this rate.” And it turned out, well, that was bullshit. You know, they could hold out a lot longer, and they probably weren’t killing them at that rate. They were doing just fine, thank you, and they were being supplied despite our best efforts, you know, to bomb the crap out of <placeName>Laos</placeName> and <placeName>Cambodia</placeName> and stuff like that. And that really worked in the long run. Caused a lot of damage, but certainly didn’t affect the progress of the war, ultimately.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Hmm.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">So no, no, I didn’t see any of that stuff. From the standpoint of, you know, a Spec 4 enlisted guy, programming in <placeName>Long Binh</placeName>, aw, no, no. They didn’t ask my opinion about stuff. They just, you know, said, you know, “Figure this thing out in this <orgName>COBOL</orgName> program.”</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">[Chuckles.] Can you describe a little bit what <orgName>COBOL</orgName> programming was like?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">[Laughs.]</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Boy, how much do you know about programming? [Laughs.] You know, I can remember—I’m speaking to people who might be listening to this in <date>20 years</date>.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="STEARNS"><orgName>COBOL</orgName> was the invention of a wonderful woman named [Rear Admiral] Grace [<persName>M.] Hopper</persName>, who I believe retired as an admiral from the <orgName>Navy</orgName>. And she’s dead now, but she’s highly regarded by people like me, who, you know—who’ve been involved in software for <date>many years</date>. And I only ever heard her talk once, but she’s just—she was absolutely brilliant. </u>
      <u who="RIDKER">[Chuckles.] Yeah, so you mentioned you were out of—out of harm’s way and out of danger, for the most part.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">So what was your—did you have much leisure time at all? What was the culture like in your office and outside?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Oh, sure. There weren’t many officers in the office. The place was pretty much run by the non-coms—you know, the non commissioned officers, warrant officers and stuff, on a sort of day-to-<date>day</date> basis. So it was fairly—everybody had a rank, but it was pretty egalitarian, really. I mean, there wasn’t any question that the noncoms who were charge of us were not as sharp as we were intellectually, so the real intellectuals in the group were the guys like, you know, me, who’d come in from—who didn’t want to be in the <orgName>Army</orgName> but here we were and we ended up doing this kind of work. </u>
      <u who="RIDKER">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">A fair amount of dope was available, easily. Marijuana was no problem at all. It was technically illegal, and they would search our hooches [huts] for it occasionally, but it was not a problem to maintain a stash. Beer was easily available at the <orgName>PX</orgName> [post exchange] and the enlisted men club, so if you were prone to alcoholism, it was easy to sink into that fog in the evening, and plenty of people did.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">And we got tapes from the <orgName>PX</orgName> or from, you know, mailing things, and we would sit around and listen to, you know, like, <persName>Eric Clapton</persName> [laughs]—Eric <persName>Clapton</persName> and <persName>Derek</persName> and the <orgName>Dominos</orgName>. It was, like, one of our favorite albums.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Hmm.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">So I know more than I wish I knew about—about heroin and heroin addiction as a result of that military experience. But I would never touch the stuff, myself.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Yeah. Was there any risk of getting trouble—getting in trouble? Sorry.	</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Oh, sure.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">During leisure time?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. When I first showed up, I think our captain, who ran the company—if he had ran it, he had somebody who was a drunk problem. He was, as it was referred to in <date>those days</date>, shipped up north, which meant they were headed for some sort of combat situation, but I think during the time I was there, that became impossible with the guys who, you know, did the transfers would look at the paperwork and say, “Hell, no, we’re not takin’ that guy! You know, we don’t need any more—we got enough trouble up here. We don’t need any more of your problems coming up north,” so he couldn't do that anymore.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Hmm.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Again, not me. I, you know, did what I had to do and wasn’t, you know, happy about the war, but—but there were people who would do, you know, things when they could to foul things up.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Yeah. Did you ever feel like you kind of like resented the work or your own contributions to the war effort, or you just had to do it because it was your duty?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">You know, more the latter. You know, when you—it wasn’t like we were involved in anything that was inherently evil. I mean, in stepping back from it, you could say, yeah, it was inherently evil. It was certainly mistaken. But, you know, we weren’t involved in—it wasn’t like [Lt. <persName>William L.] Calley [Jr.</persName>] at <persName>Mỹ Lai</persName> saying, “Line those people up and shoot them,” you know? We did not do that. All we had to do was keep track of helicopter parts. So I don’t know. I don’t know.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">That’s a deep ethical question, actually, about how for you’d go before you become complicit in what you consider to be a crime. And I have a lot of friends now who dodged the draft in a variety of creative ways. One guy sort of made himself so sick that he couldn’t pass the draft. He wasn’t sick, in fact; he just, you know, starved himself or took some drug or something. And another guy joined <orgName>the Army Reserve</orgName>. There were a hell of a lot of <orgName>Army</orgName> Reservists about my age, to the point where you about couldn’t get into those organizations because they were full of college guys who were trying to avoid <placeName>Vietnam</placeName>. Now that wouldn’t work. You know, the current <orgName>Army</orgName>, if you join <orgName>the Army Reserve</orgName>, I think they still end up going overseas. They’re essentially <orgName>Army</orgName> guys who are in some sense temporarily <orgName>Army</orgName>, but—</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">I mean, yeah, if you have any more thoughts, sure.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Yeah. It’s interesting to me personally because, of course, I went in under draft pressure. And had I been able to wait I think about one more month, I wouldn't have had any draft pressure because it ended. No, it didn’t end; it had a lottery. That’s what it was. So it was no longer up to the individual draft boards.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER"><orgName>Hmmph</orgName>.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">But I always thought, you know, looking back on the history of <date>the last 50 years</date>, that the draft ended, essentially. <name type="event">The Vietnam War</name> killed it because people were just revulsed by <name type="event">the Vietnam War</name>, and there was so much popular resistance to what was going on that <orgName>Congress</orgName> decided they would end the draft. But I think that was just a mistake. </u>
      <u who="RIDKER"><persName>Mm-hm</persName>. </u>
      <u who="STEARNS">And it’s one of the things that sort of pisses me off about the way that they treat veterans and issues like, you know, <orgName>PTSD</orgName> [post-traumatic stress disorder]. You know, the only way you’d be diagnosed with <orgName>PTSD</orgName> is it had to be really bad. And I think everybody who comes back from, you know, being in real combat situations probably has it to some degree. And I know a few people who have—you know, mostly either people I met in the <orgName>Army</orgName> when I was in the <orgName>Army</orgName> or people I’ve met since who are my age and went through <placeName>Vietnam</placeName>, because I just don’t run into <name type="event">Iraq War</name> veterans. But it’s—you know, it’s a lifetime thing. You run into these people with—I’m not sure what all the proper name for it is, but I always call it “the thousand-mile stare.” You know, they just are looking into the distance, with this sad look on their face. You know, it’s—it’s a bad thing to happen to people. Like, killing people is an unfortunate thing for anyone to have to—it better be in a good cause. So I’m philosophizing over much about that. </u>
      <u who="RIDKER"><persName>Mm-hm</persName>.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">I don’t know if you can interview him. He lives in <placeName>Maine</placeName>, I think. I don’t know if he’s on your list of people to contact, but I would highly recommend that you give him a call because his book is beautiful. It’s just a bunch of photographs he took when he was—he was an enlisted man in <placeName>Vietnam</placeName>, who somehow I think got himself assigned to be the photographer, and he took pictures of a lot of, you know, combat situations. And the book doesn’t have a whole lot of <persName>gore</persName> in it, though there’s a couple of pretty grisly pictures, but there’s a lot of pictures which, as I thumb through it—you know, he was there—he was in <placeName>Vietnam</placeName> I think <date>the year before or two years</date> before I was, so it’s—you know, I can look through it and say, Oh, boy. I remember stuff like that exactly. I remember guys looking just like that. Anyway, <persName>Dick Durrance</persName>, ’<date>66</date>, D-u-r-r-a-n-c-e. And if you poke around the library, I hope to hell there’s a copy of his book because it’s a very nice book.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Yeah, no, I’ll definitely check it out. It sounds really cool.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Oh, yeah.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">—camaraderie and, like, friendship with other guys, and I’m wondering if there are any people specifically that stand out to you in your memory that were close friends you made or still keep up with and people like that.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Boy, I didn’t keep up with any of them. Gee. Certainly was—<persName>Doug</persName>, my bunk mate—you know, it’s above-and-below kind of bunks, so you spend a lot of time with that guy. He was an interesting guy. He was from <placeName>South Dakota</placeName>, I think, and his dad was a car dealer. And he was just a charming guy, with a great smile, and I spent a lot of time sort of hanging out with him. I remember he borrowed my shoes. I had a pair—why I ever took these shoes to <placeName>Vietnam</placeName>, I don’t know, but I had a certain nice pair of brown shoes. And he had to go—he was going back on leave for <date>a couple of weeks</date>, so he borrowed my shoes. And when he came back, he regaled me with stories about what had happened, that those shoes had helped him get laid <date>one day</date>, in a <orgName>Volkswagen</orgName>,—</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">—which I—that was <persName>Doug</persName>. You know, he was that kind of guy. He would sort of encounter those situations.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Yeah. Did you keep in touch with her much?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Oh, sure. Of course, yeah. Yeah, we had—we also had a darkroom, so I used to take pictures there, myself, with my—with my <orgName>Pentax</orgName> that I’d gotten as a graduation present, and my wife used to send me rolls of film that she had shot of our new baby, for example, so I would develop those and send the prints back to her. So I was sort of the photo lab for my family.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">So was your—your daughter was born while you were in <placeName>Vietnam</placeName>? Were you able to go home?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Yes, yes, both—well, as the birthday approached, you know, everybody in <placeName>Vietnam</placeName> got to take a leave, and a lot of people didn’t bother going all the way back to the <placeName>U.S.</placeName> just because it’s a long flight. They would, like, meet their significant other in <placeName>Hawaii</placeName>, often. Or if they didn’t have a significant other, they would go to <placeName>Australia</placeName> and, you know, have a good time down there, or <placeName>Thailand</placeName> or some place like that. They’re both famous for having, you know, sort of a party atmosphere, welcoming to American soldiers.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Hmm. So you were—you went straight into school after?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Yeah. And part of the deal is, since I was in the <orgName>Army</orgName>, is a <date>two-year</date>—let’s see, it’s technically a <date>six-year</date> commitment, but I went on a thing called inactive reserve for <date>four years</date>, and they never called me. So in theory I had to keep the uniform available, my boots available and stuff should they call me up for anything, but they didn’t care. They had too many people to get rid of during that period, so they certainly weren’t calling reservists back in.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Yeah. And were you keeping up with sort of the progress of the war winding down at that time?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Oh, sure. Of course. I mean, it was still big news. And I got back in—that would have been ’71, and, you know, the war didn’t really end until ’74. </u>
      <u who="RIDKER"><persName>Mm-hm</persName>. </u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Yeah, but it was really—you know, when I was there, there wasn’t any doubt that it was going to end and that we were going to pull out. I think that they were maybe more publicly saying that, but I think everybody there kind of understood that we’re not going to win this thing, and we somehow have to get out of it. You know, can the current president, defense secretary, whatever figure out a way to do it without looking too ugly? And sort of they did.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">You know, it’s, like—you know, you look at what’s happened recently. You know, <persName>Obama</persName>—one of the things he came in was saying he’d get us out of <placeName>Iraq</placeName>. Well, he did, and now people are whining at him because the situation is deteriorating again. Well, yeah. One of the reasons we left is it was deteriorating anyway, and you leave. You’re not helping. You might as well leave. You can’t fill the country up with American troops and expect it to, you know, be a happy place. You know, we tried that in <placeName>Vietnam</placeName>. It didn’t work for shit. We tried it in <placeName>Afghanistan</placeName> for, you know, a while, and it didn’t work very well, and we tried it in <placeName>Iraq</placeName> for a while, and that didn’t work. We’re just never really good at that. </u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Hmm.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Oh, sure. Absolutely. <persName>Santa Barbara’s</persName> great. [Laughs.] I loved living there. The university there was on the beach. Very pleasant place. You know, we had an apartment, and not too long after we were there, we put together enough money and got—I didn’t mention this part of it: One of the things that I did was I probably have had most of the veterans’ benefits you can get, that I was qualified for. Being a <placeName>California</placeName>—I went into the service in <placeName>California</placeName>, so I was a <placeName>California</placeName> veteran, and the state gave—had a special loan program. And if you could get approved, because it took a little more effort to get the loan, you could buy a house for relatively little down. So we bought, you know, our first house in <placeName>Santa Barbara</placeName> was under—I don’t know how much we had to put up, but it was only a few thousand dollars, maybe a few hundred. I can’t remember. And, you know, that levered me into <placeName>California</placeName> real estate, and it’s been a good deal ever since.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Yeah. [Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">No. You know, there certainly is—I think they’re probably still around, <name type="event">Vietnam Veterans Against</name> [<name type="event">the] War</name>. I don’t know. I haven’t seen anything about them in the news. And certainly in never went anywhere near them. The guys who hang out in post-military social organizations are generally right-wingers. And that ain’t me. You know, they’re just another group of folks. So the American <orgName>Legion</orgName> guys, no, I’ve never been inside one except for the oddball party that was scheduled by some other event.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER"><persName>Mm-hm</persName>. </u>
      <u who="STEARNS">—<orgName>the American Legion</orgName> is not my kind of organization. <orgName>I’m</orgName> a Rotary [International] guy. You know, <orgName>Rotary</orgName> is my main thrust in what I do post career. You know, I try to do things to help people now [chuckles], you know, in whatever way I can. I’m not too interested in influencing public policy or any of that stuff. I just want to try to make a difference in my community and, where I can, internationally. </u>
      <u who="RIDKER"><persName>Mm-hm</persName>. </u>
      <u who="STEARNS">So since I—</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">What kind of work—sorry?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">I was just going to say, since I brought up the subject, I’ve been in <placeName>Rotary</placeName> for <date>22 years</date>, and I’ve been, you know, president of my local club. Most of my stuff, stuff I'm really interested in and have worked on over <date>the years</date> has been internationally oriented things. So I’ve done a fair amount of international travel and organizing projects. We get funding from various sources, often from <orgName>the Rotary Foundation</orgName>, itself, but often from other groups to do, you know, good things around the world.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER"><persName>Mm-hm</persName>. </u>
      <u who="STEARNS">But that’s the stuff that I’m motivated by now. So veteran stuff? Not so much. You know, you can see I mostly just grouse probably no more than anybody else does about, you know, the crazy things we get involved with overseas, the stupid military adventures, but I can’t say anybody pays much attention to me on that.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">So have there been, like—you haven’t gone to any, like, sort of reunions for veterans that you may have worked with or anything like that?</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">No, no, not at all. Like I said, you know, I have sort of—I guess I would say mostly fond memories with the people I was associated with, at least the enlisted men in <placeName>Vietnam</placeName> and in Fort Hood, but I certainly haven’t stayed in touch with them. I still have one good friend that I happened to meet. He was exactly the same situation as I did. You know, we both arrived at <orgName>University of California</orgName>, <placeName>Santa Barbara</placeName> at the same time, having gotten out for the same reason. He hadn’t been sent to <placeName>Vietnam</placeName>, but he managed to get out of the <orgName>Army</orgName> on an early release also, to attend <orgName>UCSB</orgName>. I’m still a good friend of his. </u>
      <u who="RIDKER">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">—eating MREs—you know, Meals Ready to Eat, They’re K-rations, if you could find them. But we haven’t done that for a long time. And I think I still—I still do have two of my <placeName>Vietnam</placeName> shirts, because they were cut loose, so they still fit me fairly well.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Huh.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Everything else, I got rid of.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Huh. So this—as one more kind of, like, final question, kind of more open ended, I’m just interested in hearing your thoughts on how your service in <placeName>Vietnam</placeName> has sort of shaped the rest of your life. I know you’ve mentioned already a bit about your political views, but just generally how it’s shaped you in other ways.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Aw, boy! Well, I think it made me certainly more tolerant and appreciative of people who aren’t like me [chuckles], you know? In particular, not just Americans but also the Vietnamese I met. You know, God knows it was an artificial thing. You know, the Vietnamese I met usually on post were the women who cleaned up for us. But, you know, just having a chance to chat with them a little bit and trying to get some sense of what their lives are like and, you know, how do they survive on a daily basis. I suspect that did have an effect that sort of lingered into my—you know, my Rotary preferences.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">[Chuckles.] </u>
      <u who="STEARNS">You know, don’t they pay attention to the way the world works? Anyway,—so I’m running out of things to say.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Oh, yeah. I mean—oh, it’s—it’s an interesting point. And I guess this could be a good place to wrap up. So, again, thank you so much, <persName>Dave</persName>, for taking the time to participate in the Dartmouth Vietnam Project and to talk to me. It’s a really good opportunity for me to have a chance to hear of your stories and hear your thoughts, so thank you so much again.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">Sure. Good. Yeah, I’m glad to help. Try to find <persName>Durrance</persName>. He definitely has some things to say, I bet.</u>
      <u who="RIDKER">Yeah, I’ll keep an eye out for that, for sure. I’ll let you know. Thanks again, though.</u>
      <u who="STEARNS">All right.</u>
